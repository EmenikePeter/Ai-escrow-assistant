# AI Escrow Assistant: The Smart Way to Secure Online Payments with Stripe

In today’s digital economy, online transactions happen every second. Whether you’re buying a product, hiring a freelancer, or selling a service, ensuring that your money and trust are protected is more important than ever. Enter AI Escrow Assistant — a next-generation mobile app that leverages artificial intelligence to provide safe, secure, and transparent escrow services, now enhanced with Stripe payment integration.

## What is AI Escrow Assistant?

AI Escrow Assistant is an intelligent escrow platform that acts as a trusted middleman in online transactions. Instead of sending money directly to a seller or service provider, payments are held securely in escrow until all parties fulfill their commitments. Using AI, the app monitors transactions, detects suspicious activity, and ensures fairness in every deal.

Whether you’re a freelancer seeking payment protection, a buyer wary of scams, or a seller wanting assurance that funds are secured, AI Escrow Assistant gives you confidence in every transaction.
